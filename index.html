    <h3>Host</h3>

    <li>
          <br><br>

          <b>Host</b> are any device which <i>sends</i> or
          <i>receive</i> traffic.
          (Examples : Computers, Phones, smart TVs, smart watches, etc)

          <br><br>

          Host typically fall in two categories <i>clients</i> or
          <i>servers</i>. <b>Clients</b> initiate request <b>servers</b>
          respond. These terms are relative to specific communication.
          (A <i><b>server</b></i> is a computer with software installed
           which responds to specific request)

    </li>

    <h3>IP Address</h3>

    <li>

          An <b>IP Address</b> is the identity of each host.
          An <i>IP address</i> is needed to send or
          receieve <i>packets</i> on a network.
          <i>IP addresses</i> get stamped on everything
          that each <i>host</i> sends.

          <br><br>
          <img src="img/exp18.png" alt="example" class="re-size">
          <br><br>

          For example when a client makes a web request to <i>site.com</i>, it
          sends a <b>packet</b> which includes <i>what web page it is asking for</i>, as
          well as a <i>source ip address</i>, and a <i>destination ip addresses</i>.

          <br><br>

          The <b>source ip address</b> is going to be the client's ip address,
          and the <b>destination ip address</b> is going to be the server's ip
          address.

          <br><br>

          <i>IP addresses</i> are typically assigned in some sort
          of hierachy.

          <br><br>

    </li>

    <h3>Network</h3>

    <li>

      A <b>network</b> is what actually does the transportation of
      traffic between hosts. In it's simplest form anytime you connect
      two hosts you have a <i>network</i>.

      <br><br>

      Before networks in order to transfer data between hosts required
      portable media (disks, thumb drives, etc...).

      <br><br>

      A network is really just a logical grouping of hosts which
      require similar connectivity. Networks can contain other
      networks which is reffered to as <b>Sub-Networks</b> (<b>Subnets</b>).

      <br><br>

      Instead of having networks connect directly to each
      other in every possible combination, networks are connected
      to a central resource, the <b>internet</b> which is simply
      a bunch of <i>interconnected networks</i>, networks connected
      to other networks.

      <li><b>Repeaters</b> regenerate signals</li>
      
      <h3>Hub</h3>
      <li><b>Hubs</b> are multiport repeaters.</li>
      
      <h3>Bridge</h3>
      <li><b>Bridges</b> sit between <i>HUB</i> connected hosts.</li>
      
      <h3>Switch</h3>
      <li>A <b>switch</b> facilitates communication <i>within</i> a
      network.</li>
      
      <h3>Routers</h3>
      <li>A <b>switch</b> facilitates communication <i>between</i> a

      <h3>Gateway</h3>
      <li>A <b>gateway</b> is each hosts way out of their network.</li>

    <h1 class="tittles space">OSI model</h1>

    <h3>Intro</h3>

    <li>

          The purpose of <i>networking</i> is to allow
          two hosts to share data with one another.
          <i>Networking</i> allows us to automate all this
          across the wire. <i>Hosts</i> must follow a set of rules
          in order to achive this.
          <i>Networking</i> also has its own set of rules, the rules
          for networking are divided into seven different layers
          known as the <b>OSI model</b>.

      <br><br>

      <mark>OSI is simply a model, NOT RIGID.</mark>

          <br><br>

        <img src="img/exp2.gif" alt="example" class="re-size">

      <br>
      2) Data Link ; <mark>Hop to hop</mark> ; NIC, MAC Address, Routers, Switch
      <br>
      3) Network ; <mark>End to end</mark> ; IP Address 
      <br>
      4) Transport ; <mark>Service to Service</mark> ; 
         Two common address schemes to distinguish dates streams
         are <b>TCP</b> & <b>UDP</b> which are <b>ports</b>.

         <i>TCP</i> favors reliability. <i>UDP</i> favots efficiency.
        Port #s range from 0-65535. 

        <br><br> 

        Servers listen for request to pre-defined <i>ports</i>.
        Clients make request to the IP address & to the port # in question.
        Clients also select a random <b>source port</b> for each 
        connection. 

        <br><br> 

        When a packet is initially send from a client it 
        includes a <b>Source</b> (<b>SRC</b>) & <b>Destination</b> (<b>DST</b>)
        
          <br><br>
          <img src="img/exp22.png" alt="example" class="re-size">

          ??This process occurs for each connection made the client 
          the client. In each case the client is searching a new 
          random source port. 

          <br><br>

          <i>Ports</i> ensure that the right application gets the 
          right data. THis process also allows the client to make 
          multiple connections to the sme server. 
          (exp : when client/browser opens a new tab, a new random 
          source port is created.)

                        <i>Switches</i> facilitates communication within a network(review).
                        A <b>node</b> is a device the implements IP.
                        A <b>router</b> is a <i>node</i> that forwards <i>IP packets</i> not
                        explicitly to itself.
                        A <b>host</b> is any <i>node</i> that is not a router.

                        <br><br> 
                  
                        A router forwards packets not destined to themselves.
                        Routers are <i>connected</i> to a network by having 
                        an IP & MAC address on <i>each interface</i> (<i>network</i>).
                        To do this routers must have a <b>routing table</b> corrilating
                        to each route in <i>each network</i>. 
                        Each route has its own routing table. 

                        <br><br>

                                    
                        Routers use the routing tables to send <i>packets</i>.
                        <i>Routing tables</i> can be populated via 3 methods ;
                        <i>Directly Connected</i>, <i>Static Routes</i>, 
                        & <i>Dynamic Routers</i>. 

                        <br><br>

                        <b>Directly connected</b> are routes for the Network which are
                        attached. 
                        When routes receive packets with an unknown <i>destination IP</i>, 
                        packet is dropped.

                          MAC address. 
                          Routers have <b>ARP Tables</b>, mapping of <i>L3</i> to <i>L2</i> address.
                          (Everying with an <i>IP address</i> has an <i>ARP Table</i>)
